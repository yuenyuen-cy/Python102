# Monday Motivational Quotes SMTP #

We are finally moving away from GUIs and web development for Day 32 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b> and I thought it was a pretty good timing to create a new repositary on Github. For Day 32, there is actually 2 projects on SMTP which is basically an automated way to send emails using Python. For the first half, completed on 29/9/24, I followed along the tutorial and made a weekly motivational quote email subscription. Got a bit carried away and got my first subscriber (my boyfriend), only to find out that I have to run the code manually for it to work. Obviously, I was not going to do that every week but it would be cool to learn more about APIs. Very fun project and I have the second half to complete on my own.
