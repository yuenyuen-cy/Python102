# Monday Motivational Quotes #

We are finally moving away from GUIs and web development for Day 32 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b> and I thought it was a pretty good timing to create a new repositary on Github. For Day 32, there is actually 2 projects on SMTP which is basically an automated way to send emails using Python. For the first half, completed on 29/9/24, I followed along the tutorial and made a weekly motivational quote email subscription. Got a bit carried away and got my first subscriber (my boyfriend), only to find out that I have to run the code manually for it to work. Obviously, I was not going to do that every week but it would be cool to learn more about APIs. Very fun project and I have the second half to complete on my own.

# Automated Birthday Wisher ##

For part 2 of Day 32 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 30/9/24, I made an automated birthday wisher which would automatically send a randomised birthday email to my friends on their birthday. Kind of a silly idea but it helped me to get a better understanding on how email subscription services work. There was 3 difficulty for me to choose from: normal, hard and extra hard. I chose to go with hard and managed to complete it by myself by referring to the past projects. Also learnt that I can use PythonAnyWhere to schedule the code to automatically run weekly or yearly but I think I'll pass on that for now.

# ISS Overhead Notifier #

Day 33 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 02/10/24. Just a little update, I have been slowing down on this course due to school commitments. Even though I started learning Python purely for fun, the skills I have learnt has came in handy as I now need to apply ML for my Masters thesis project. Even though it is overwhelming for me as I have just started on coding one month ago, this course has given me some confidence to accept the challenge! While I still intend to complete all 100 days of code, I might need to split my time into learning advanced Machine Learning while also focusing on the fundamentals through this course.<br><br>

For Day 33, I learnt about Application Programming Interfaces (API), something I have always heard about but never really knew what they were. For this project, I made use of two different APIs to create a email notification programme that will inform me when the International Space Station (ISS) is directly overhead me. It was relative straightforward and took me 30 minutes to complete.

# Quizzler App #

Day 34 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 03/10/24. For this project, I developed the Quizzler app utilizing a trivia API and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The most significant challenge I faced was implementing object-oriented programming and organizing the UI code within a class structure. Additionally, managing functions across multiple Python files proved to be quite complex. Even though the final product looked very simple, I did learn a lot from this challenge.

# Rain Alert #

Day 35 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 06/10/24. Learnt more about API and authentication keys and created a rain alert that sends myself a text message every morning at 8am if it was going to rain that day! This project was really fun and made use of trial versions of paid services such as <i>Open Weather Map</i> and <i>Twilio</i>. Key takeaway from this lesson is that there isn't a fixed way to use an API, hence reading the documentation is very important. Decided to let Twilio keep running until the expiry date because this tool actually feels pretty useful!
