# Monday Motivational Quotes ‚òïÔ∏è #

We are finally moving away from GUIs and web development for Day 32 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b> and I thought it was a pretty good timing to create a new repositary on Github. For Day 32, there is actually 2 projects on SMTP which is basically an automated way to send emails using Python. For the first half, completed on 29/9/24, I followed along the tutorial and made a weekly motivational quote email subscription. Got a bit carried away and got my first subscriber (my boyfriend), only to find out that I have to run the code manually for it to work. Obviously, I was not going to do that every week but it would be cool to learn more about APIs. Very fun project and I have the second half to complete on my own.

# Automated Birthday Wisher üéÇ #

For part 2 of Day 32 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 30/9/24, I made an automated birthday wisher which would automatically send a randomised birthday email to my friends on their birthday. Kind of a silly idea but it helped me to get a better understanding on how email subscription services work. There was 3 difficulty for me to choose from: normal, hard and extra hard. I chose to go with hard and managed to complete it by myself by referring to the past projects. Also learnt that I can use PythonAnyWhere to schedule the code to automatically run weekly or yearly but I think I'll pass on that for now.

# ISS Overhead Notifier üõ∞ #

Day 33 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 02/10/24. Just a little update, I have been slowing down on this course due to school commitments. Even though I started learning Python purely for fun, the skills I have learnt has came in handy as I now need to apply ML for my Masters thesis project. Even though it is overwhelming for me as I have just started on coding one month ago, this course has given me some confidence to accept the challenge! While I still intend to complete all 100 days of code, I might need to split my time into learning advanced Machine Learning while also focusing on the fundamentals through this course.<br><br>

For Day 33, I learnt about Application Programming Interfaces (API), something I have always heard about but never really knew what they were. For this project, I made use of two different APIs to create a email notification programme that will inform me when the International Space Station (ISS) is directly overhead me. It was relative straightforward and took me 30 minutes to complete.

# Quizzler App üí° #

Day 34 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 03/10/24. For this project, I developed the Quizzler app utilizing a trivia API and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The most significant challenge I faced was implementing object-oriented programming and organizing the UI code within a class structure. Additionally, managing functions across multiple Python files proved to be quite complex. Even though the final product looked very simple, I did learn a lot from this challenge.

# Rain Alert ‚òîÔ∏è #

Day 35 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 06/10/24. Learnt more about API and authentication keys and created a rain alert that sends myself a text message every morning at 8am if it was going to rain that day! This project was really fun and made use of trial versions of paid services such as <i>Open Weather Map</i> and <i>Twilio</i>. Key takeaway from this lesson is that there isn't a fixed way to use an API, hence reading the documentation is very important. Decided to let Twilio keep running until the expiry date because this tool actually feels pretty useful!

# Stock News Alert üìà #

Mini Capstone Project for Day 36 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 07/10/24. Challenge today was to develop an SMS notification system that alerts users when a stock price moves by 5%. As a casual trader, I found this project particularly engaging. There were 3 levels of difficulties; Normal, Hard or Extra Hard. I felt like having a little challenge today so I opted for Extra Hard. The starting file was empty but I felt pretty confident in the steps I need to take to complete the challenge. <br><br>

The most significant roadblock I encountered was an unexpected KeyError that surfaced despite the code functioning properly before. After about 10 minutes of troubleshooting, I realized that the API provider limits free users to 25 requests per day. I subsequently managed to work around this limitation by saving the stock data in a separate python file. Additionally, I faced some challenges when indexing the multi-layered JSON structure, often running into errors through multiple trials before finally getting it right. I ended up taking 1 hour 47 minutes to complete the project, which is probably the longest I have spent on a single project in this course. However, I am still very glad I made it through with Extra Hard difficulty!

# Pixela Habit Tracker üóì #

Simple project for Day 37 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 08/10/24. Objective of today's project was to learn the other types of HTTP requests, i.e. post, put, delete. The API documentation was also very clear and easy to follow.

<i>Note: The graph looks kind of bare because I was unable to populate the tracker due to API limitations!</i>

# Workout Tracker üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄ #

Day 38 of <b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>, completed on 10/10/24. Today was a frustrating day for coding üò≠ For this project, we used Nutritionix and Sheety API to create a workout tracker on Google Sheets. I thought this project wouldn't take more than 1 hour because I just had to follow the instructions. However, I had a bit of struggle indexing the JSON response from the Nutritionix API and figuring out how to use the Sheety API (The documentation was so vague!) After finishing the code, the last task was to set sensitive data as environmental variables. The instructions given on Stack Overflow wasn't clear but I managed to figure out how to set them in PyCharm. However, the biggest frustration set in when I was unable to figure out why the run button was greyed out. I tried searching for solutions everywhere, tried deleting the evironmental variables and setting them again, and added in a debugging line, but the code just wouldn't run. Finally, I closed the PyCharm window and opened it again... and it worked. I guess the biggest takeaway from today was learning how to deal with the frustrations of coding. On a more positive note, I find it really impressive that there are APIs available for Natural Language Processing (NLP). They make AI and machine learning much more accessible to researchers or product designers who may not have extensive coding experience.
